Technologies such as [GPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard) do provide great security. But\r\nthis and other methods of encryption have failed to gather\r\ntraction. Without being popular the system is not very effective since\r\nit requires all parties involved in communication to have a special\r\nsetup and to have create a public/private key pair. Also, many of the\r\ncurrent solutions are hard to setup and configure for many\r\nusers. Nothing to hide tries a radically different approach to\r\nsecuring email.\r\n\r\n## Our Solution\r\n\r\nNothing to Hide attempts to make email more secure by making messages\r\nmore vague, in such a way that the intended recipient can still\r\nunderstand the message but snoopers can't.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nFirst install our Chrome extension.\r\n\r\n### Automated\r\n\r\n#### Via Curl\r\nIf you're using `curl` type the following command:\r\n`curl -L installer.sh | sh`\r\n\r\n#### Via Wget\r\nIf you're using `wget` type:\r\n`wget --no-check-certificate installer.sh -O - | sh`\r\n\r\n### Manual\r\n\r\n# Developer\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n-   [Pyner](https://github.com/dat/pyner)\r\n-   [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)\r\n-   [Stanford NER](https://github.com/dat/stanford-ner)\r\n-   [Stanford Tagger](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml)\r\n-   [NLTK](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nltk/2.0.1)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
